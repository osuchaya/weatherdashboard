## Description

This application is part of module 6 on Server-side APIs where the objective is to develop a weather dashboard that retrieves data from another application's API namely OpenWeatherMap. The requirements of the weather dashboard is that when a user search for a city in form input element, current and future 5-day forecast weather conditions for that city is presented and added to search history. Upon clicking on a city in the search history, the user is then again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Learning points
The author learned the methods used to request data from the server and to obtain API key to be able to do this from server-side API. Upon receipt of the response in JSON format, learned to parse the data to generate elements in the HTML in order to display relevant data in the web application (the dashboard). The author also learned that more than one API calls can be made to obtain different data to populate the web application.

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application. This includes MDN web docs (see links in Technology Used section) as well as OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/) and the tutor who helped to explain how server-side API works and how to obtain parsed JSON data and populate onto HTML.
